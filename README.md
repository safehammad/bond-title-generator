# James Bond Film Title Generator

This command line application attempts to generate a novel random James Bond film titles based loosely on the existing James Bond film titles. Here are some typical examples:

- Never Say Love Again
- Die Another Sky
- Casino Thunder
- A Time to Die

## How it works

The entire catalogue of James Bond film titles is listed in the [templates.clj](src/safehammad/templates.clj) file. The words making up each title have been tagged with their [parts of speech ](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) such as noun, verb and adjective etc.

The generator works as follows:

1. A title is picked from the list at random.
2. A single word is removed from that title and its part of speach noted.
3. An alternative word with the same part of speech is picked at random from the other titles to replace the removed word.

## Bonus feature

This application can generate other novel output in addition to James Bond film titles. The full list is:

- James Bond film titles.
- Star Wars film titles
- Harry Potter film/book titles
- Power Rangers Dino Charge series episode titles
- Famous English proverbs and sayings

In the case of English proverbs, a blend of proverbs is called a [malaphor](https://www.thoughtco.com/malaphor-word-play-1691298). Here are some examples:

- The grass is better on the other side.
- Actions speak louder than chickens.
- Absence makes the bird grow fonder.
